## Modules
Node uses modules for extension of you methods. In this project we used:
- readline
- figlet
- chalk
- clis-table

to install the modules you need to type the following in the same filepath in cmd:
```
npm install readline figlet chalk clis-table
```
NOTE: This meight not be necesery.

To initialize the modules type the following in your script document:
```
const readline = require('readline');
const figlet = require('figlet');
const chalk = require('chalk');
const Table = require('cli-table');
```
